        "Objective: The analysis aims to gain insights into the booking patterns, trends, and seasonality. It helps identify peak booking periods, booking lead times, and booking spikes. This information can be used for capacity planning, revenue optimization, and resource allocation. Analyzing hotel bookings can provide insights into revenue management strategies. This involves understanding pricing dynamics, optimizing room rates based on demand, and identifying opportunities to maximize revenue through tactics like upselling or offering package deals.\n",

        "The Project is related to Hotel Booking and It Consists Of Two Kinds Of Hotel First City Hotel and Other Resort Hotel. We Are Given a Dataset to Understand and Analyze Data from Dataset Get a Proper Output from That Data. In This Dataset, It Contain a Total Of 119390 Rows And 32 Columns.\n",

        "We Divide Data Manipulation in Three Category Data Collection, Data Cleaning and Manipulation and EDA(explanatory Data Analysis).\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Collection: Find Different Columns Which is done by Coding head(), tail(), info(), describe(), columns() also other methods are used for Data Collection. Identify the key variables such as hotel type, booking dates, customer demographics, room types, prices, etc. Some of the columns name is updated here i.e.hotel,is_canceled,lead_time,arival_date_year, arival_date_month, arival_date_date, arival_date_day, arival_date_number,stays_in_weekend_nights and other columns. Calculate basic statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range for numerical variables like prices or booking durations. For categorical variables like hotel type or room type, determine the frequency distribution of different categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Cleaning: As we further, we find unique vales of each columns and generate a list in tabular form also check the dataset type of each columns find some columns not in accurate data types which correct it later done in data cleaning part and as well as duplicate data items must be removed we will remove duplicate dataset later. when we find missing value we will use fillna().Before visualize any data from the data set we have to do data wrangling that, we are checked the null value of all the column.\n",
        "\n",
        "EDA: This consists of explanatory data analysis where we deal with problem statement and try to find the solution of problem statement and visualize the data in graphical format to get to the actual understanding of problem. to understand booking patterns we must use visualization tools like matplotlib and seaborn. Plot the number of bookings over time to observe any seasonal trends or booking spikes. create bar charts or pie charts to visualize the distribution of bookings by hotel type, room type, or customer segments. Determine the cancellation rate by analyzing the number of canceled bookings compared to the total bookings. Investigate the reasons for cancellations, such as booking lead time, customer demographics, or room availability. We can Explore the demographics of the customers who made bookings. Also Create visualizations or summary statistics to understand the distribution of customers by age, gender, nationality, or any other relevant demographic variables. We can create a relationship between prices and booking patterns. Also the average prices by hotel type, room type, or booking period. Identify any pricing strategies or trends that might affect booking behavior. We can perform further analysis such as customer segmentation, revenue analysis, or predictive modeling to forecast future bookings.\n",
